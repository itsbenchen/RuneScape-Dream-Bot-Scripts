# RuneScape-Dream-Bot-Scripts

Overview:

These are some RuneScape Dream Bot scripts that utilizes the DreamBot's API in the client.jar file.
The scripts are meant to automate tasks to make things easier to do while the player can do other things while the bot is run.

## What is DreamBot?

DreamBot is essentially an Old-school RuneScape Botting program that runs scripts to automate tasks in the game.
More information about the program and the likes can be referenced here: https://dreambot.org/

For more extensive info about DreamBot's API, you can check out: https://dreambot.org/javadocs/ 

## How do I add the script to the program?

You simply need to place the scripts in your local folder called "Scripts" in your DreamBot folder.
The location of the DreamBot folder will vary, but it will usually be your computer's individual user folder (i.e. User > Name_Of_User > DreamBot -> Script).
That folder is usually created after launching DreamBot's client for the first time.

Note: The client.jar IS NOT the actual client. You'll need to download the client from the actual website. The purpose of client.jar in here is that the scripts depend on the provided API, which is located in the client.jar file.
