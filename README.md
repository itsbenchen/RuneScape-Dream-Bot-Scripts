# RuneScape-Dream-Bot-Scripts

These are some old RuneScape Dream Bot scripts that utilizes the DreamBot's API in the client.jar file.
In the past, I've built scripts for DreamBot's community to use, but I have now stopped as I no longer play RuneScape.
If you're planning to write scripts using DreamBot's API but do not know how to write them, you may look at some of these scripts to get a general idea on how to implement them for your particular bot. 
The scripts are meant to automate tasks to make things easier to do while the player can do other things while the bot is run.

Note: These scripts may still work, but certain functions utilized in the scripts may be deprecated now.

## What is DreamBot?

DreamBot is essentially an Old-school RuneScape Botting program that runs scripts to automate tasks in the game.
More information about the program and the likes can be referenced here: https://dreambot.org/

## How do I add the script to the program?

You simply need to place the scripts in your local folder called "Scripts" in your DreamBot folder.
The location of the DreamBot folder will vary, but it will usually be your computer's individual user folder (i.e. User > Name_Of_User > DreamBot -> Script).
That folder is usually created after launching DreamBot's client for the first time.

Note: The client.jar is NOT the actual client. You'll need to download the client from the actual website. The purpose of client.jar in here is that the scripts depend on the provided API, which is located in the client.jar file.
